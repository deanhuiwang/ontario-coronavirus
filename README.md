# Ontario Coronavirus Cases
I plotted the daily number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario and fit an
exponential curve to the data.

## Sources
I used these sources for the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases:
* https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus
* https://www.cbc.ca/
* https://globalnews.ca/

See `OntarioCoronavirus.xlsx` or `OntarioCoronavirus.csv` for the source
articles for each data point.
